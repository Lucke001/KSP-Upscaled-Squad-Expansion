Enhancement of Stock Squad Expansion texture folders in 3 different settings
<br>
<br>


<b>Process:</b>

- Used <a href="https://www.xnview.com/en/">XNView MP</a> to first convert the DDS to PNG;
- Took <a href="https://upscayl.org/">Upscayl</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models">custom model</a> 4X_NMKD-SIAK_200k, 4x scale to all of Squad's folders, recursively.
- Retook <a href="https://www.xnview.com/en/">XNView MP</a> to re-convert to DDS
- Created RAW folder for textures
- Used the program <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111378">DDS Converter</a> from Nexus Mods to convert to 3 different settings:<br>
    High:    8192x8192 Textures<br>
    Medium:  4196x4196 Textures<br>
    Low:     2048x2048 Textures<br>
  The Compression is in DDS BC3 (DXT5), but I kept all the PNG and enhanced them as well to keep the original file structure

<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>

Be careful of what mods you are using with this package, as it is VERY demanding on hardware. I personnaly use the low settings because I use <a href="https://www.patreon.com/linx_/posts">Link's Parallax v2.0</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/blackrack/posts">Blackrack Volumetrics Clouds</a> from their patreon, plus <a href="https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/KSC_Extended">KSC Extended</a>, <a href="https://spacedock.info/mod/2306/KSC Harbor">KSC Harbor</a> & <a href="https://spacedock.info/mod/3654/KSC Enhanced">KSC Enhanced</a> that utilize stock assets, which decrease overall FPS in KSC area.

I recommend testing with: <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/ShowFPS">Show FPS</a> & <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/MemGraph">MemGraph</a>. You will have a good idea of the performance hit you get with the textures.

Have fun and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=UXU2LPN8EKLAE">buy me a cofee</a> if you like this mod!
