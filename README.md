Enhancement of Stock Squad Expansion texture folders in 3 different settings<br>
<b><a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Squad">[1.12.X] KSP Upscaled - Squad goes in pair with this mod</a></b>
<br>
<br>


<b>Process:</b><br><br>

- Used XNView MP to first convert the DDS to PNG;<br>
- Took Upscayl, with custom model 4X_NMKD-SIAK_200k, 4x scale to all of Squad's folders, recursively.<br>
- Retook XNView MP to re-convert to DDS<br>
- Created RAW folder for textures<br>
- Used XNView MP to compress the DDS textures to 3 different settings:<br>
  Low: 2048x2048 Textures<br>
  Medium: 4196x4196 Textures<br>
  High: 8192x8192 Textures<br>
- I kept all the PNG, enhanced them and kept the original file structure along the process.<br><br>


<b>Installation instructions:</b><br>

(Please note that you need all the DLC`s as the packages do not include any of the configs or models, it is only textures)<br>

- <a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Squad-Expansion/releases">Download the settings you want in the release section;</a><br>
  Low: 2k Textures maximum<br>
  Medium: 4k Textures maximum<br>
  High: 8k Textures maximum<br>
- Extract to the GameData folder;
- Overwrite all when prompted;
- Play<br><br>


<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>

Be careful of what mods you are using with this package, as it is VERY demanding on hardware. I personnaly use the low settings because I use <a href="https://www.patreon.com/linx_/posts">Link's Parallax v2.0</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/blackrack/posts">Blackrack Volumetrics Clouds</a> from their patreon, plus <a href="https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/KSC_Extended">KSC Extended</a>, <a href="https://spacedock.info/mod/2306/KSC Harbor">KSC Harbor</a> & <a href="https://spacedock.info/mod/3654/KSC Enhanced">KSC Enhanced</a> that utilize stock assets, which decrease overall FPS in KSC area.

I recommend testing with: <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/ShowFPS">Show FPS</a> & <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/MemGraph">MemGraph</a>. You will have a good idea of the performance hit you get with the textures.

Have fun !
