Enhancement of Stock Squad Expansion texture folders in 3 different settings<br>
<b><a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Squad">[1.12.X] KSP Upscaled - Squad goes in pair with this mod</a></b>
<br>
<b><a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Core">[1.12.X] KSP Upscaled - Core is recommended with this mod</a></b>
<br>
<br>

<b>Process:</b><br><br>

- Used XNView MP to first convert the DDS to PNG;<br>
- Took Upscayl, with custom model 4X_NMKD-SIAK_200k, 4x scale to all of Squad's folders, recursively.<br>
- Retook XNView MP to re-convert to DDS<br>
- Created RAW folder for textures<br>
- Used XNView MP to compress the DDS textures to 3 different settings:<br>
  Low: 2048x2048 Textures<br>
  Medium: 4196x4196 Textures<br>
  High: 8192x8192 Textures<br>
- I kept all the PNG, enhanced them and kept the original file structure along the process.<br><br>


<b>Installation instructions:</b><br>

(Please note that you need all the DLC`s as the packages do not include any of the configs or models, it is only textures)<br>

- <a href="https://github.com/Lucke001/KSP-Upscaled-Squad-Expansion/releases">Download the settings you want in the release section;</a><br>
  Low: 2k Textures maximum<br>
  Medium: 4k Textures maximum<br>
  High: 8k Textures maximum<br>
- Extract to the GameData folder;
- Overwrite all when prompted;
- Play<br><br>


<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>

Be careful of your RAM usage with this package, as it is VERY demanding on hardware. You will notice that your RAM compresses the files during the process, liberating some precious space to run the game

I recommend testing with: <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/ShowFPS">Show FPS</a> & <a href="https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/MemGraph">MemGraph</a>. You will have a good idea of the performance hit you get with the textures.

Have fun !
